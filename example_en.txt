## Detailed Explanation
### **Concept Explanation**

#### 1. Flow of Electricity: Current and Electric Charge

The essence of what we call 'electricity' in daily life is the movement of tiny particles called **electrons**. The flow of electrons moving in one direction inside a wire is called **electric current**.

- **Current ($I$)**: A quantity indicating how strongly electricity flows. The unit used is the **Ampere [A]**. A current of 5[A] means 5 times more electrons are flowing than a current of 1[A].

- **Electric Charge ($Q$)**: The total amount of electricity that has flowed over a certain period. In other words, it indicates how many electrons have moved. The unit used is the **Coulomb [C]**.

There is a very important relationship between current, electric charge, and time. Current represents 'how much electric charge has flowed during 1 second'.
$$ \text{Current} = \frac{\text{Electric Charge}}{\text{Time}} $$
Expressing this with symbols:
$$ I = \frac{Q}{t} $$
| Symbol | Meaning | Unit |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| $I$ | Current | Ampere [A] |
| $Q$ | Charge | Coulomb [C] |
| $t$ | Time | Second [s] |

By rearranging this formula, we can calculate the total electric charge that flowed during a specific time.
$$ Q = I \times t $$
**Why is this formula important?**: This formula allows us to calculate the total amount of electricity that has flowed if we know the intensity of the current and the time. For example, if a 5[A] current flowed for 10 seconds, the total electric charge is $5 \text{ [A]} \times 10 \text{ [s]} = 50 \text{ [C]}$. The important point here is that **the unit of time must be seconds [s]**.

#### 2. Electrolysis and Faraday's Laws

**Electrolysis** is the process of causing a chemical reaction by passing electricity through a liquid (usually a solution). For example, splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen by passing electricity through it is a representative form of electrolysis. The **silver plating** mentioned in the problem is also a type of electrolysis. When an object is placed in a silver nitrate ($AgNO_3$) solution where silver (Ag) is dissolved and electricity is passed through, silver ions in the solution adhere to the surface of the object, coating it with a thin silver film.

The 19th-century scientist **Michael Faraday** discovered an important law while studying this electrolysis phenomenon. This is called **Faraday's Law of Electrolysis**.

**Faraday's First Law**: "The amount of substance produced (deposited) at an electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the total quantity of electricity that passed through the solution."

Breaking this down simply:
- The more electricity flows (the larger the total electric charge $Q$),
- The more metal sticks (the amount of deposited substance $W$ increases).

This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:
$$ W \propto Q $$
Here, the symbol '$\propto$' means 'is proportional to'.

To turn this proportional relationship into an equation, a **proportionality constant** is needed. This constant is called the **electrochemical equivalent**, and the symbol $k$ is used.
$$ W = k \times Q $$

- **Electrochemical Equivalent ($k$)**: This is a unique value for a substance, indicating "how much substance (g) can be deposited with 1 Coulomb (C) of electric charge." The unit is **[g/C]**. For example, if the electrochemical equivalent of silver (Ag) is $1.118 \times 10^{-3}$ [g/C], it means that passing 1[C] of electric charge deposits $1.118 \times 10^{-3}$[g] of silver. Other substances like copper or gold have different values.

#### 2.1. Final Calculation Formula

Now, let's combine the two formulas learned above.
1. Electric Charge Calculation: $Q = I \times t$
2. Deposition Amount Calculation: $W = k \times Q$

Substituting $Q$ from formula 1 into formula 2, we get the final formula for solving electrolysis problems.
$$ W = k \cdot I \cdot t $$

This formula is the core of electrolysis calculation problems.

| Symbol | Meaning | Unit |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| $W$ | Amount of deposited substance (Mass) | Gram [g] |
| $k$ | Electrochemical Equivalent | Gram per Coulomb [g/C] |
| $I$ | Current | Ampere [A] |
| $t$ | Time | Second [s] |

**Most Important Caution**: When using this formula, the unit of time $t$ **must be 'seconds'**. This is because the unit of current, Ampere [A], means 'Coulombs flowing per 1 second [C/s]'. If the problem gives time in 'minutes' or 'hours', you must convert it to 'seconds'.

#### 2.2. What happens at the electrodes (Cathode/Anode)?

There are two electrodes in electrolysis: the **Anode (+)** which carries a positive charge, and the **Cathode (-)** which carries a negative charge.

Metal ions dissolved in the solution (e.g., silver ions $Ag^+$) carry a positive (+) charge. Since opposite poles attract like magnets, these cations move toward the **Cathode (-)** which carries a negative charge.

Ions arriving at the cathode gain electrons and return to their original metal atoms, sticking firmly to the surface of the cathode. This process is called **deposition**.

**Core Memorization Rule:**
- **Cathode (-)**: Metal ions stick to it, so it **becomes thicker**.
- **Anode (+)**: If the anode is made of the same type of metal, it dissolves to replenish the ions, so it **becomes thinner**.

If an exam question asks "What phenomenon occurs at the cathode?", the answer is almost always "It becomes thicker" or "Metal is deposited."

#### 2.3. What is 'Chemical Equivalent'?

Sometimes, problems do not give the electrochemical equivalent ($k$) directly but require calculating the **chemical equivalent**. These are related concepts, but distinct in exams.

Chemical equivalent can be calculated with a simple formula.
$$ \text{Chemical Equivalent} = \frac{\text{Atomic Weight}}{\text{Valence}} $$

- **Atomic Weight:** The relative mass of an atom. (Always given in the problem.)
- **Valence:** The number of electrons an atom gives or takes when forming a chemical bond. (Also given in the problem.)

**Example:** If the atomic weight of Nickel (Ni) is 58.7 and the valence is 2, the chemical equivalent of Nickel is $58.7 \div 2 = 29.35$.

### **Standard Problem Explanation**

Now let's solve the standard problem step by step.

**Problem**: Electrolysis of silver nitrate ($AgNO_3$) solution is performed for silver plating. When a current of 5[A] flows for 30 minutes, approximately what is the amount of silver (Ag) deposited at the cathode in [g]? (Note: The electrochemical equivalent of silver is $1.118 \times 10^{-3}$ [g/C].)

---

**Step 1: Identify the Goal**

The problem asks for "the amount of silver (Ag) deposited." Thus, the goal is to find the mass $W$. The unit is grams [g].

---

**Step 2: Organize Given Information**

Organize the values given in the problem into symbols.

- Current ($I$): 5 [A]
- Time ($t$): 30 minutes
- Deposited Substance: Silver (Ag)
- Electrochemical Equivalent of Silver ($k$): $1.118 \times 10^{-3}$ [g/C]

---

**Step 3: Select Formula**

Since it is a problem calculating the amount of substance deposited through electrolysis, use Faraday's Law formula $W = kIt$.

$$ W = k \cdot I \cdot t $$

---

**Step 4: Check and Convert Units (Most Important Step!)**

Before substituting values into the formula, ensure all units are correct.
- $k$: [g/C] - Correct.
- $I$: [A] - Correct.
- $t$: 30 minutes - **Incorrect unit.** In the formula, time $t$ must be in **seconds**.

Therefore, convert 'minutes' to 'seconds'.
$$ 1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds} $$
$$ t = 30 \text{ minutes} = 30 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 1800 \text{ seconds} $$

**Common Mistake**: If you skip this step and substitute $t=30$ as is, you get a completely different answer. Exams often give time in 'minutes' or 'hours' to induce this mistake, so always be careful.

---

**Step 5: Substitute Values into Formula**

Now that all units are correctly converted, substitute the values into the formula.

- $k = 1.118 \times 10^{-3}$
- $I = 5$
- $t = 1800$

$$ W = (1.118 \times 10^{-3}) \times 5 \times 1800 $$

---

**Step 6: Calculate**

Proceed with the calculation in order.

1.  It is convenient to calculate the total electric charge $Q = I \times t$ first.
    $$ Q = 5 \text{ [A]} \times 1800 \text{ [s]} = 9000 \text{ [C]} $$

2.  Now calculate the deposition amount $W = k \times Q$.
    $$ W = (1.118 \times 10^{-3} \text{ [g/C]}) \times 9000 \text{ [C]} $$
    $10^{-3}$ is the same as $\frac{1}{1000}$, and $9000$ is the same as $9 \times 1000$.
    $$ W = (1.118 \times \frac{1}{1000}) \times (9 \times 1000) $$
    Here, $1000$ and $\frac{1}{1000}$ cancel each other out.
    $$ W = 1.118 \times 9 $$
    $$ W = 10.062 \text{ [g]} $$

---

**Step 7: Compare with Choices**

The calculated result is 10.062 [g]. Check the choices.

① 0.17
② 1.68
③ 10.06
④ 33.54

The value closest to the calculation result is ③ 10.06.

**Final Answer**: ③

### **Question Patterns & Examiner’s Win Conditions**

Let's look at the traps intended by the examiner in this type of problem and strategies to counter them.

| Pattern Type | Example Problem | Examiner's Intent (Trap) | Candidate's Counter-strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Time Unit Trap** | Current of $10[A]$ flows through copper sulfate solution for **60 minutes**. Amount of copper deposited? | Giving time in 'minutes' or 'hours' induces the candidate to calculate without conversion. Calculating with $t=60$ yields a wrong answer. | **Must convert time to seconds.** Convert $60 \text{ min} = 60 \times 60 = 3600 \text{ s}$ and then substitute into $W=kIt$. |
| **2. Formula Manipulation** | To deposit **1kg** of copper at the cathode, approximately how many **hours** should a **200A** current flow? | Instead of finding $W$, requires transforming the formula to find $t$ or $I$. Also gives mass in [kg] not [g], and asks for time in 'hours' not 'seconds', requiring multiple conversions. | 1. Transform formula to $t = \frac{W}{kI}$.<br>2. Match all units to base units. $1\text{kg} = 1000\text{g}$.<br>3. Convert calculated time (seconds) back to requested unit (hours). (Result $\div 3600$) |
| **3. Law Name Question** | Which law states that the amount of substance deposited in electrolysis is proportional to the total electric charge? | Makes you confuse it with Faraday's 'Law of Induction' or other similarly named laws. | If keywords 'Electrolysis', 'Deposition', 'Chemical Equivalent' appear, immediately recall **Faraday's Law of Electrolysis**. |
| **4. Unit Conversion Question** | How many [C] is 1 [Ah]? | Makes the unit [Ah] feel unfamiliar to cause confusion. | Think based on the formula $Q=It$. Calculate calmly: $1\text{Ah} = 1\text{A} \times 1\text{h} = 1\text{A} \times 3600\text{s} = 3600\text{C}$. |
| **5. Electrode Phenomenon** | What phenomenon occurs at the cathode during electrolysis of copper sulfate solution? | Checks if you know the basic principle of electrolysis (which pole deposition occurs at). | Memorize the core rule: **"The cathode becomes thicker."** Positive (+) ions are attracted to the negative (-) pole, so metal deposition always happens at the cathode. |
| **6. Chemical Equivalent Calc** | Nickel's valence is 2, atomic weight is 58.70. What is the chemical equivalent? | Asks if you know the definition and formula for chemical equivalent, rather than $W=kIt$ calculation. | Memorize **`Chemical Equivalent = Atomic Weight / Valence`** and calculate by direct substitution. |

### **Study Method**

Here is an efficient study method to completely conquer this type of problem.

#### **1. Memorize This**

- **Core Formula (Deposition Calculation)**:
  $$ W = kIt $$
  - $W$: Deposition amount [g]
  - $k$: Electrochemical equivalent [g/C]
  - $I$: Current [A]
  - $t$: Time **[s]** (Remember it's seconds!)

- **Core Formula (Chemical Equivalent Calculation)**:
  $$ \text{Chemical Equivalent} = \frac{\text{Atomic Weight}}{\text{Valence}} $$

- **Basic Formula (Electric Charge)**:
  $$ Q = It $$

- **Core Rule (Electrode Phenomenon)**:
  - At the **Cathode (-)**, metal is deposited and it **becomes thicker**.

- **Law Name**:
  - **Faraday's Law of Electrolysis**

- **Essential Unit Conversions**:
  - 1 minute = 60 seconds
  - 1 hour = 60 minutes = 3600 seconds
  - 1 [Ah] = 3600 [C]

#### **2. Understand This**

- **Core Principle**: Understand the simple principle that the result of electrolysis (deposition amount) is directly proportional to 'how much electricity flowed (total electric charge)'. The formula is just a numerical expression of this principle.

- **Importance of Units**: Understand why the time unit must be 'seconds'. Since the definition of current (A) itself implies 'electric charge flowing per 1 second (C/s)', you must multiply by 'seconds' to get the total charge. Understanding this principle prevents unit conversion errors.

- **Principle of Electrodes**: Understand why deposition happens at the cathode. Just remember the principle of nature that (+) charged metal ions are attracted to the (-) charged cathode 'opposite poles attract'.

#### **3. Actionable Plan**

1.  **Memorize Formulas/Rules**: Write the 'Memorize This' list above 3 times in a notebook to perfectly memorize the meaning and units of each symbol. Especially write **(Seconds!)** large next to $t$, and link 'Cathode → Thicker' to memorize.
2.  **Calculation Practice**:
    - Solve the standard problem again by yourself.
    - Find and solve problems that require formula manipulation (finding time $t$) and calculating chemical equivalent, as shown in the 'Question Patterns' above.
3.  **Concept Check**: Read through concept questions asking about "Faraday's Law" or phenomena at the "Cathode", and train to link keywords with the correct answers.

**Big Data Based Summary**: In the Electrical Craftsman written exam, problems related to Faraday's Law appear largely in three types: **1) Calculation of Deposition ($W$)**, **2) Cathode/Anode Phenomena**, **3) Calculation of Chemical Equivalent**. Among these, **deposition calculation problems are the most frequent**, and **giving time units in 'minutes' is the most common trap**. If you firmly master the memorization list presented above, you can solve all problems of this type.

### 1. **Concept Explanation**

I will explain all the basic concepts needed to solve electrical circuit problems by comparing them to the phenomenon of water flowing through pipes.

#### **1.1. The 3 Basic Elements of Electricity: Voltage, Current, Resistance**

1.  **Voltage ($V$)**
    *   **Concept:** Voltage is the "pressure" or "force" that makes electricity flow. It is like the pressure of a pump pushing water in a pipe. Just as water flows stronger with higher pressure, electricity flows stronger with higher voltage.
    *   **Unit:** Volt, symbol is $V$. (e.g., 60[V])

2.  **Current ($I$)**
    *   **Concept:** Current is the "flow" of electricity itself. It indicates how much electricity passes through a specific point during 1 second. It is like how much water flows through a pipe in 1 second (flow rate).
    *   **Unit:** Ampere, symbol is $A$. (e.g., 2.5[A])

3.  **Resistance ($R$)**
    *   **Concept:** Resistance is the degree of "obstruction" to the flow of current. It is like water flow being hindered if a pipe gets narrower or has obstacles inside. The higher the resistance, the harder it is for current to flow.
    *   **Unit:** Ohm, symbol is $\Omega$. (e.g., 4[$\Omega$])

#### **1.2. Ohm's Law**

This is the most important law explaining the relationship between these three elements.

*   **Principle:** "The **current ($I$)** flowing in a circuit is proportional to the **voltage ($V$)** and inversely proportional to the **resistance ($R$)**."
*   **Explanation:**
    *   If voltage (pressure) increases, naturally current (flow) gets stronger. ($I$ is proportional to $V$)
    *   If resistance (obstruction) increases, naturally current (flow) gets weaker. ($I$ is inversely proportional to $R$)
*   **Formula:**
    $$ V = I \times R $$
    This formula can be rearranged to find current or resistance.
    $$ I = \frac{V}{R} \quad \text{and} \quad R = \frac{V}{I} $$
*   **Use Case:** Used to calculate the remaining value when knowing two of voltage, current, or resistance in a circuit. It is the foundation of all electrical circuit analysis.

#### **1.3. Power and Energy**

1.  **Power ($P$)**
    *   **Concept:** Power is the amount of work electricity does in 1 second, i.e., the rate of energy consumption. Higher power means giving off brighter light or generating hotter heat.
    *   **Unit:** Watt, symbol is $W$.
    *   **Formula:** Can be expressed in three forms by combining with Ohm's Law; use the formula convenient for the given values.
        $$ P = V \times I $$
        $$ P = I^2 \times R \quad (\text{Substituting } V=IR) $$
        $$ P = \frac{V^2}{R} \quad (\text{Substituting } I=V/R) $$

2.  **Energy (Electric Work, $W$)**
    *   **Concept:** Energy is the total amount of energy used over a specific time. Electricity bills are charged based on this energy.
    *   **Unit:** Joule (J) or Watt-hour (Wh). $1[J] = 1[W] \times 1[s]$.
    *   **Formula:**
        $$ W = P \times t \quad (\text{Energy} = \text{Power} \times \text{Time}) $$
    *   **Example:** If a 3[kW] bulb is used for 20 hours, the energy is $3[kW] \times 20[h] = 60[kWh]$.

#### **1.4. Connection Methods of Resistors: Series and Parallel**

1.  **Series Connection**
    *   **Shape:** Connecting resistors in a single line like a train.
    *   **Characteristics:**
        *   **Current is Constant:** Since there is only one path, the exact same current flows through all resistors.
        *   **Voltage divides:** The total voltage is divided across each resistor.
        *   **Total Resistance (Equivalent Resistance):** Simply add up each resistance value. Total resistance increases as you connect more.
    *   **Formula:**
        $$ R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \dots $$

2.  **Parallel Connection**
    *   **Shape:** Connecting resistors side-by-side by tying their starting points and ending points together.
    *   **Characteristics:**
        *   **Voltage is Constant:** The exact same voltage is applied to all resistors.
        *   **Current divides:** Total current splits into each resistor.
        *   **Total Resistance (Equivalent Resistance):** As more are connected in parallel, there are more paths for current, so total resistance decreases.
    *   **Formula:**
        $$ \frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \dots $$
        *   **Tip! (Most Important):** Formula used when only two resistors are in parallel.
        $$ R_{total} = \frac{R_1 \times R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \quad (\text{Product over Sum}) $$

#### **1.5. Conductance ($G$)**

*   **Concept:** Conductance is the reciprocal of resistance ($G=1/R$), representing how "well" current flows. If resistance is the degree of obstruction, conductance is the degree of allowing passage.
*   **Unit:** Siemens (S) or Mho (℧).
*   **Formula:** All relationships are opposite to resistance.
    *   $G = \frac{1}{R} = \frac{I}{V}$
    *   **In Parallel:** $G_{total} = G_1 + G_2 + \dots$ (Calculated like series resistance)
    *   **In Series:** $\frac{1}{G_{total}} = \frac{1}{G_1} + \frac{1}{G_2} + \dots$ (Calculated like parallel resistance)

#### **1.6. Kirchhoff's Laws**

Used to analyze complex circuits difficult to solve with just Ohm's Law.

1.  **1st Law (Current Law, KCL):** "The sum of currents entering a point (junction) in a circuit equals the sum of currents leaving that point." Like water splitting at a pipe junction. Amount of water in equals amount of water out.
    $$ \sum I_{in} = \sum I_{out} $$

2.  **2nd Law (Voltage Law, KVL):** "Around any closed loop in a circuit, the sum of voltage rises (voltage supplied by battery) equals the sum of voltage drops (voltage consumed by resistors)."
    $$ \sum E (\text{EMF}) = \sum IR (\text{Voltage Drop}) $$

#### **1.7. Current Divider and Voltage Divider Rules**

1.  **Voltage Divider Rule (In Series Circuits):**
    *   **Principle:** In a series circuit, total voltage is divided **proportionally** to the size of each resistance. Higher resistance gets more voltage.
    *   **Formula:** Voltage $V_1$ across $R_1$ is:
        $$ V_1 = V_{total} \times \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2} $$

2.  **Current Divider Rule (In Parallel Circuits):**
    *   **Principle:** In a parallel circuit, total current divides **inversely proportional** to the size of each resistance. Smaller resistance gets more current.
    *   **Formula:** Current $I_1$ through $R_1$ is:
        $$ I_1 = I_{total} \times \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} $$
    *   **Caution:** Remember that the numerator contains the **opposite resistor** $R_2$ when finding $I_1$.

#### **1.8. Battery and Internal Resistance**

1.  **Battery:** A device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy to supply constant voltage (Electromotive Force, E).
2.  **Internal Resistance ($r$):** No battery is perfect; there is slight resistance inside due to materials. This is always treated as being connected in **series** with the external circuit resistance.
3.  **Connection of Batteries:**
    *   **Series:** Voltage and internal resistance add up ($V_{total}=nE, r_{total}=nr$), capacity stays the same. Used when higher voltage is needed.
    *   **Parallel:** Voltage stays same ($V_{total}=E$), total internal resistance decreases to $r_{total} = r/n$, capacity adds up. Used when longer usage is needed.
4.  **Battery Capacity:** Uses Ampere-hour (Ah) unit. 1Ah means it can supply 1A current for 1 hour.
    *   **Formula:** Capacity [Ah] = Current [A] × Time [h]

#### **1.9. Maximum Power Transfer Theorem**

*   **Concept:** Condition for when maximum power is transferred from a source (including internal resistance $r$) to a load (external resistance $R$).
*   **Condition:** Maximum power is transferred when **load resistance $R$ equals source internal resistance $r$**.
    $$ R = r $$
*   **Max Power Formula:** When the above condition is met, the max power $P_{max}$ consumed at load $R$ is:
    $$ P_{max} = \frac{E^2}{4r} $$
    (Where E is the source EMF.)

#### **1.10. Capacitor**

1.  **Concept:** A component that temporarily stores electric charge. Similar to storing water in a tank.
2.  **Capacitance ($C$):** The ability to store charge.
    *   **Unit:** Farad (F). Microfarad ($\mu F = 10^{-6}F$) is commonly used.
3.  **Basic Formula:** Relationship between stored charge $Q$, capacitance $C$, and applied voltage $V$.
    *   $$ Q = C \times V $$
    *   **Unit:** Unit of charge $Q$ is Coulomb (C). (Note: Variable symbol $C$ is 'Capacitance', Unit symbol C is 'Coulomb', so be careful not to confuse them.)
4.  **Connection of Capacitors (Opposite to Resistors!)**
    *   **Parallel Connection:** Simply add up. (Like resistor series calculation)
        $$ C_{total} = C_1 + C_2 + \dots $$
    *   **Series Connection:** Reciprocal of sum of reciprocals. (Like resistor parallel calculation)
        $$ \frac{1}{C_{total}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \dots $$
5.  **Voltage Divider for Capacitors (In Series)**
    *   **Principle:** Voltage across capacitors in series divides **inversely proportional** to capacitance. Smaller capacitance gets more voltage.
    *   **Formula:** Voltage $V_1$ across $C_1$ is:
        $$ V_1 = V_{total} \times \frac{C_2}{C_1 + C_2} $$
    *   **Caution:** Like the current divider for resistors, remember the numerator has the **opposite capacitance** $C_2$. For example, with $C_1=2[\mu F]$ and $C_2=4[\mu F]$ in series and 12[V] applied, voltage across $C_1$ is $V_1 = 12[V] \times \frac{4[\mu F]}{2[\mu F] + 4[\mu F]} = 12 \times \frac{4}{6} = 8[V]$. You can see the smaller capacitance gets the larger voltage.

#### **1.11. Resistance of a Conductor**

*   **Concept:** Wire resistance depends on material, length, and thickness.
*   **Formula:**
    $$ R = \rho \frac{L}{A} $$
    *   $R$: Resistance [$\Omega$]
    *   $\rho$ (rho): Resistivity [$\Omega \cdot m$]. Unique value for material (Copper, Aluminum, etc.).
    *   $L$: Length of conductor [m]. Resistance increases with length.
    *   $A$: Cross-sectional area [m²]. Resistance decreases with thickness (area).
*   **Important Type:** If length is doubled "while volume remains constant", the area becomes 1/2 to maintain volume. Thus resistance becomes $R' = \rho \frac{2L}{A/2} = 4 (\rho \frac{L}{A}) = 4R$, which is **4 times**. Resistance is proportional to the **square** of the length change.

### 2. **Standard Problem Explanation**

Now, let's solve the given problem step-by-step based on the concepts learned.

**Problem:** In a circuit like the figure below, what is the current flowing through resistor $R_3$ in [A]?
(Circuit Description: A DC power source of 60[V] is connected in series with resistor $R_1=4[\Omega]$. This series resistor is connected to a part where $R_2=6[\Omega]$ and $R_3=12[\Omega]$ are connected in parallel.)

**Solution Strategy:**
This circuit is a **mixed circuit** where $R_1$ is in series with the parallel part ($R_2$, $R_3$). Solve by simplifying complex parts.
1.  Combine parallel $R_2$ and $R_3$ into one equivalent resistor.
2.  The circuit then becomes a simple series circuit with source, $R_1$, and the equivalent resistor found.
3.  Calculate the total resistance of this simple series circuit.
4.  Use Ohm's Law to find the current flowing through the whole circuit (Total Current).
5.  Since this total current splits into $R_2$ and $R_3$, use the Current Divider Rule to finally calculate the current in $R_3$.

---

**Step-by-step Solution:**

**Step 1: Circuit Analysis & Goal Setting**

*   Source Voltage $V = 60$[V]
*   Resistor $R_1 = 4$[$\Omega$]
*   Resistor $R_2 = 6$[$\Omega$]
*   Resistor $R_3 = 12$[$\Omega$]
*   $R_2$ and $R_3$ are in parallel; this parallel part is in series with $R_1$.
*   Goal is to find current in $R_3$, i.e., $I_3$.

**Step 2: Calculate Equivalent Resistance of Parallel Part**

First, combine parallel $R_2$ and $R_3$ into one. Let's call this $R_{23}$. Using "Product over Sum" formula for two parallel resistors:

*   **Formula:** $R_{23} = \frac{R_2 \times R_3}{R_2 + R_3}$
*   **Calculation:**
    $$ R_{23} = \frac{6 \times 12}{6 + 12} = \frac{72}{18} = 4[\Omega] $$
*   Now the complex parallel part can be thought of as a single $4[\Omega]$ resistor. The circuit is now a simple series circuit of $R_1$ and $R_{23}$.

**Step 3: Calculate Total Equivalent Resistance of Circuit**

From Step 2, the circuit is $R_1$ and $R_{23}$ in series. Total resistance $R_{total}$ is the sum.

*   **Formula:** $R_{total} = R_1 + R_{23}$
*   **Calculation:**
    $$ R_{total} = 4[\Omega] + 4[\Omega] = 8[\Omega] $$
*   Thus, the whole circuit is equivalent to one 8Ω resistor connected to a 60V source.

**Step 4: Calculate Total Current**

Now use Ohm's Law to calculate total current $I_{total}$ leaving the source (60V).

*   **Formula:** $I_{total} = \frac{V}{R_{total}}$
*   **Calculation:**
    $$ I_{total} = \frac{60[V]}{8[\Omega]} = 7.5[A] $$
*   This $7.5[A]$ current leaves the source, passes through $R_1$, and reaches the junction of $R_2$ and $R_3$.

**Step 5: Calculate $I_3$ using Current Divider Rule**

Total current $I_{total} = 7.5[A]$ splits into $R_2$ and $R_3$. We need current in $R_3$ ($I_3$), so apply the Current Divider Rule.

*   **Formula:** $I_3 = I_{total} \times \frac{\text{Opposite Resistance}}{\text{Sum of Resistors}} = I_{total} \times \frac{R_2}{R_2 + R_3}$
*   **Calculation:**
    $$ I_3 = 7.5[A] \times \frac{6[\Omega]}{6[\Omega] + 12[\Omega]} $$
    $$ I_3 = 7.5 \times \frac{6}{18} $$
    $$ I_3 = 7.5 \times \frac{1}{3} $$
    $$ I_3 = 2.5[A] $$

**Conclusion:**
The current flowing through resistor $R_3$ is **2.5[A]**. Therefore, the answer is **②**.

### 3. **Question Patterns & Examiner’s Win Conditions**

Identifying traps and patterns helps reduce mistakes.

**Main Problem Patterns:**

1.  **Mixed Circuit Calculation (Most Frequent):** Calculating current/voltage in specific parts of series-parallel mixed circuits like the standard problem.
2.  **Battery + Internal Resistance:** Batteries in series/parallel + load. Key is calculating total EMF and total resistance (internal+external).
3.  **Max Power Transfer:** Given EMF($E$) and internal resistance($r$), asks for max power ($P_{max}$) at load. Apply condition $R=r$ and formula $P_{max} = E^2/4r$.
4.  **Capacitor Circuits:** Series/Parallel capacitors. Asking for equivalent capacitance, total charge ($Q=CV$), or voltage/charge on specific capacitor.
5.  **Power/Energy Calculation:** Given V, I, R, calc Power (P). Or change conditions (e.g., voltage change) and ask power change. Or given P and time, calc Energy (W).
6.  **Conductor Resistance:** Wire length change. If "volume constant", remember resistance is proportional to length **squared**.

**Examiner’s Traps (Win Conditions) & Counter-strategies:**

1.  **Trap: Confusing Current Divider Formula**
    *   *Situation:* Putting $R_3$ in numerator when finding $I_3$.
    *   *Strategy:* Remember "Current flows more where resistance is small", and memorize that the numerator takes the **'Opposite'** resistor.
2.  **Trap: Confusing Resistor vs Capacitor Formulas**
    *   *Situation:* Adding capacitors in series like resistors, or taking reciprocals for parallel.
    *   *Strategy:* Clearly memorize **"Capacitors are opposite to Resistors"**.
3.  **Trap: Applying Total Voltage to Partial Circuit**
    *   *Situation:* Calculating $I_3$ as $60V / 12\Omega = 5A$.
    *   *Strategy:* Remember voltage divides in series circuits. The voltage across $R_3$ is much less than 60V.
4.  **Trap: 'Square' Relationship in Conductor Resistance**
    *   *Situation:* Thinking resistance doubles when length doubles, even with 'constant volume'.
    *   *Strategy:* If 'constant volume' appears, immediately recall resistance is proportional to length 'squared' ($R \propto L^2$).

## Detailed Explanation
### 1. Concept Explanation

Let's learn basic concepts one by one to solve electric circuit problems. These concepts are like bricks for building a house; understanding each one firmly is necessary to understand the whole circuit.

#### 1.1. Basic Elements of Electric Circuits

It is easy to understand if you compare an electric circuit to a water pipe system.

*   **Current ($I$)**: The flow of electricity. Like 'amount of flowing water' in a pipe. Unit is **Ampere (A)**.
*   **Voltage ($V$)**: The force (pressure) that makes current flow. Like 'water pressure' in a pipe. Higher voltage flows more current, just as higher pressure flows water stronger. Unit is **Volt (V)**.
*   **Resistance ($R$)**: An element that **obstructs** the flow of current. Like a 'narrowing' or 'filter' in a pipe. Higher resistance obstructs flow more. Unit is **Ohm (Ω)**.
*   **Inductor ($L$) or Coil**: An element that opposes 'sudden changes' in current. Think of it as a 'heavy waterwheel' in a pipe. If water tries to flow suddenly, it starts turning slowly due to inertia, and if water tries to stop suddenly, it keeps turning. Unit is **Henry (H)**. **Crucially, the calculation method for connecting multiple inductors is exactly the same as for resistors.**
*   **Capacitor ($C$) or Condenser**: An element that 'stores' electricity. Like a 'rubber balloon' or 'small tank' in a pipe. It stores electricity when voltage is applied and releases it when needed. Unit is **Farad (F)**.

The most important law representing the relationship between Resistance, Voltage, and Current is **Ohm's Law**.
$$V = I \times R$$
This means Voltage ($V$) equals Current ($I$) times Resistance ($R$). So for same voltage, higher resistance means lower current, and lower resistance means higher current.

#### 1.2. Basics of Capacitor: Charge and Capacitance

We said a capacitor stores electricity. We need a concept to represent how much electricity it stores.

*   **Charge ($Q$)**: The quantity of electricity itself. Like 'amount of stored water'. Unit is **Coulomb (C)**.
*   **Capacitance ($C$)**: The ability or size of a capacitor to store charge. Like 'size' or 'capacity' of a water tank. Unit is **Farad (F)**.

There is an important relationship between Capacitance ($C$), Voltage ($V$), and Charge ($Q$).
$$Q = C \times V$$
This means:
"The amount of charge ($Q$) stored in a capacitor is proportional to the capacity ($C$) and the applied voltage ($V$)."
Just as the amount of water ($Q$) stored in a tank increases with a larger tank ($C$) and higher water pressure ($V$). This formula is critical in capacitor problems.

#### 1.3. Connection Methods: Series and Parallel

There are two main ways to connect multiple elements (resistors, capacitors, etc.): Series and Parallel.

*   **Series Connection**
    *   **Concept:** Connecting elements in a single line, like a train. There is **only one path** for current to flow.
    *   **Analogy:** Connecting narrow pipe pieces one after another. Water must pass through all narrow paths in order.
    *   **Characteristics:**
        *   Current flows equally through all elements. (Only one path).
        *   Total resistance (Equivalent resistance) is simply the **sum of each resistance**. Since narrow paths are added, it becomes harder for water to flow overall.

*   **Parallel Connection**
    *   **Concept:** Connecting starting points together and ending points together. Current splits into multiple paths and merges again. There are **multiple paths**.
    *   **Analogy:** One large pipe splitting into smaller pipes and merging back. Water flows through multiple paths.
    *   **Characteristics:**
        *   Voltage is applied equally to all elements. (Start and end points are same).
        *   Total resistance (Equivalent resistance) becomes **smaller** than individual resistances. Since paths increase, current flows more easily overall.

#### 1.4. Equivalent Resistance and Inductance Calculation

Formulas for Total (Equivalent) value ($R_{eq}$, $L_{eq}$) in Series and Parallel. Resistors and Inductors share the same calculation method.

*   **Series Connection**:
    *   **Principle:** Obstructions increase, so total obstruction is the sum.
    *   **Formula**:
        $$R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \dots$$
        $$L_{eq} = L_1 + L_2 + L_3 + \dots$$

*   **Parallel Connection**:
    *   **Principle:** Multiple paths make flow easier, so resistance decreases.
    *   **General Formula (3+ items)**:
        $$\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \dots$$
        (Take the reciprocal of the result to get $R_{eq}$.)
    *   **Special Formula (2 items)**: Convenient to memorize as "Product over Sum".
        $$R_{eq} = \frac{R_1 \times R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$$

#### 1.5. Equivalent Capacitance Calculation

Calculation for capacitors is **opposite to resistors**. This is the key point.

*   **Series Connection (Like Resistor Parallel)**:
    *   **Principle:** Connecting capacitors in series effectively widens the gap between plates, **decreasing** storage ability.
    *   **General Formula (3+ items)**:
        $$\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \frac{1}{C_3} + \dots$$
    *   **Special Formula (2 items)**:
        $$C_{eq} = \frac{C_1 \times C_2}{C_1 + C_2}$$

*   **Parallel Connection (Like Resistor Series)**:
    *   **Principle:** Connecting in parallel effectively combines plate areas, widening the area, **increasing** storage ability.
    *   **Formula**:
        $$C_{eq} = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + \dots$$

#### 1.6. Strategy for Mixed Series-Parallel Circuits

For mixed circuits, you can't calculate everything at once. Divide the circuit into simple blocks and calculate step-by-step.

**Strategy: Inside out, Complex to Simple!**

1.  Find the innermost pure series or parallel part.
2.  Calculate the equivalent value of that part.
3.  Imagine replacing that part with a **single element** having that value and redraw the circuit mentally.
4.  Find the next pure series/parallel part in the simplified circuit and repeat 1-3.
5.  Continue until the whole circuit remains as one element.

---

### 2. Standard Problem Explanation

Let's solve the standard problem step-by-step using these concepts.

**Problem**: What is the equivalent resistance between terminals a-b in the circuit like the figure?

**Circuit Analysis**:
*   At terminal a, there is $R_1 = 4\Omega$.
*   After $R_1$, the path splits into two. This implies **Parallel Connection**.
*   Top path has one resistor $R_2 = 12\Omega$.
*   Bottom path has $R_3 = 2\Omega$ and $R_4 = 4\Omega$ in a line. This implies **Series Connection**.
*   The two paths merge and lead to terminal b.

This circuit is a structure where $R_1$ is in **Series** with a (Parallel part). Inside that parallel part, there is a ($R_3$ and $R_4$ Series).

**Step-by-Step Solution**:

**Step 1: Calculate the innermost simple part (Series resistors in bottom branch)**

According to the strategy, the first part to calculate is the series connection of $R_3$ and $R_4$ in the bottom branch.

*   **Concept**: Series Equivalent Resistance
*   **Formula**: $R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2$
*   **Calculation**:
    Let's call this $R_{34}$.
    $$R_{34} = R_3 + R_4 = 2\Omega + 4\Omega = 6\Omega$$

*   **Check**: Now the circuit is simpler:
    *   $R_1 = 4\Omega$ from a,
    *   followed by a parallel connection of Top ($R_2 = 12\Omega$) and Bottom ($R_{34} = 6\Omega$).

**Step 2: Calculate the Parallel part**

Now calculate the parallel connection of the simplified circuit. Top branch $R_2 = 12\Omega$ and Bottom branch equivalent $R_{34} = 6\Omega$ are in parallel.

*   **Concept**: Parallel Equivalent Resistance (2 resistors)
*   **Formula**: $R_{eq} = \frac{R_1 \times R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$ ("Product over Sum")
*   **Calculation**:
    Let's call this parallel total $R_p$.
    $$R_p = \frac{R_2 \times R_{34}}{R_2 + R_{34}} = \frac{12\Omega \times 6\Omega}{12\Omega + 6\Omega} = \frac{72}{18}\Omega = 4\Omega$$

*   **Common Mistake**: Don't confuse numerator and denominator. Always "Sum" is bottom, "Product" is top.

*   **Check**: Now the circuit is much simpler:
    *   $R_1 = 4\Omega$ from a,
    *   followed by the combined parallel part $R_p = 4\Omega$ connected in **Series** to b.

**Step 3: Calculate Final Equivalent Resistance**

Finally, find total resistance $R_{ab}$ between a-b. This is $R_1$ and $R_p$ in series.

*   **Concept**: Series Equivalent Resistance
*   **Formula**: $R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2$
*   **Calculation**:
    $$R_{ab} = R_1 + R_p = 4\Omega + 4\Omega = 8\Omega$$

**Final Conclusion**:
The total equivalent resistance is $8\Omega$. Thus, the answer is **② 8**.

### 3. Question Patterns & Examiner’s Win Conditions

Examiners set traps to check if you understand concepts or just memorized formulas loosely.

**Pattern 1: Confusing Series/Parallel Formulas**
*   **Example**: "What is equivalent resistance of $R_1, R_2$ connected in parallel?"
*   **Intent**: Checking if you confuse Series (Sum) and Parallel (Product/Sum).
*   **Strategy**: Remember image: "Series gets longer -> bigger resistance (+), Parallel gets wider -> smaller resistance (complex fraction)".

**Pattern 2: Confusing Resistor (R) vs Capacitor (C)**
*   **Example**: "If condensers are connected in series, equivalent capacitance (increases/decreases)."
*   **Intent**: Trap using the fact C is opposite to R.
*   **Strategy**: Memorize **"Capacitor is Opposite to Resistor!"**
    *   Resistor Series = Sum  ↔  Capacitor **Parallel** = Sum
    *   Resistor Parallel = Product/Sum  ↔  Capacitor **Series** = Product/Sum

**Pattern 3: Max/Min Value Question**
*   **Example**: "With 5 identical resistors, ratio of max equivalent resistance to min?"
*   **Intent**: Understanding conceptual meaning of connections.
*   **Strategy**: Remember principle.
    *   **Max R/L**: **All Series** ($n \times R$)
    *   **Min R/L**: **All Parallel** ($R / n$)
    *   (Capacitor is opposite. Max C is Parallel, Min C is Series.)

**Pattern 4: Calculation Order in Mixed Circuits (Standard Problem)**
*   **Example**: Mixed series/parallel circuit.
*   **Intent**: Evaluating analysis and order of operations.
*   **Strategy**: **"Inside out, Chunk by Chunk!"** Find independent series/parallel chunks, calc, replace with single element.

**Pattern 5: Conductance (G), Admittance (Y)**
*   **Example**: "Equivalent Admittance of $Y_1, Y_2$ in parallel?"
*   **Intent**: Checking knowledge of reciprocals ($G=1/R, Y=1/Z$).
*   **Strategy**: Reciprocal relation means calculation rules are **Opposite**. So, **Same rules as Capacitor.**
    *   G/Y Parallel = Sum (Like Resistor Series)
    *   G/Y Series = Product/Sum (Like Resistor Parallel)

**Pattern 6: Diamond Shape (Wheatstone Bridge)**
*   **Example**: Diamond shape 5 resistors. "Resistance X when galvanometer reads 0?"
*   **Intent**: Checking knowledge of 'Equilibrium Condition'.
*   **Strategy**:
    1.  **Check Condition**: If "Equilibrium" or "Current is 0", use formula: **Product of opposite resistors is equal.** ($R_1 R_x = R_2 R_3$)
    2.  **Shortcut**:
        *   If equilibrium, **ignore the middle resistor**. Treat as open circuit.
        *   If finding X, use the product formula.

**Pattern 7: Total Charge Calculation**
*   **Example**: "$30[\mu F]$ and $40[\mu F]$ condensers in parallel with 100[V]. Total charge?"
*   **Intent**: Checking 2-step application: 1) $C_{eq}$ calculation, 2) $Q=CV$ formula.
*   **Strategy**:
    1.  Calc **Total Capacitance $C_{eq}$**. (Parallel: $30+40=70\mu F$)
    2.  Use **$Q_{total} = C_{eq} \times V$**. ($70\mu F \times 100V$)

### 4. Study Method

Efficient plan to conquer this type.

**1. Memorize This!**

The table below is the core. Write it down multiple times.

| Connection | Resistor (R) / Inductor (L) | Capacitor (C) / Conductance (G) / Admittance (Y) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Series** | **Sum (Add)**<br> $R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + \dots$ | **Product/Sum (Fraction)**<br> $\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \dots$ <br> (2 items: $\frac{C_1 C_2}{C_1 + C_2}$) |
| **Parallel** | **Product/Sum (Fraction)**<br> $\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \dots$ <br> (2 items: $\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$) | **Sum (Add)**<br> $C_{eq} = C_1 + C_2 + \dots$ |

*   **Core Sentence**: "R/L Series is Sum, Parallel is Product/Sum. C/G/Y is Opposite!"
*   **Capacitor Formula**: $Q = C \times V$
*   **Max/Min**:
    *   R Max → All Series ($n \times R$)
    *   R Min → All Parallel ($R / n$)
*   **Wheatstone Bridge**: Product of facing resistors is equal. ($R_1 R_x = R_2 R_3$)

**2. Understand This!**

*   **Series vs Parallel**: Understand via pipe analogy why series increases R and parallel decreases R.
*   **Capacitor Rule**: Understand the principle (Series=wider gap=less C, Parallel=wider area=more C) to avoid confusion.
*   **Mixed Circuit Order**: Internalize "Simplification Strategy" (innermost chunk first).

**3. Action Plan**

1.  **Step 1 (Concepts)**: Memorize table and sentences perfectly.
2.  **Step 2 (Basic)**: Solve 3-5 pure series/parallel problems for R and C. Practice 'Opposite Rule'.
3.  **Step 3 (Mixed)**: Solve mixed circuits like the standard problem. **Redraw the simplified circuit at each step.** This reduces mistakes drastically.
4.  **Step 4 (Applied)**: Solve Max/Min, Conductance, Bridge, Charge calc problems.
5.  **Wrong Answers**: Analyze why. 'Calc error', 'Formula mixup (R vs C)', 'Order error', 'Forgot Q=CV'.

By practicing this, equivalent circuit calculation will become one of your strongest topics.

## Detailed Explanation
### **Joule's Law and Heat Calculation**

### 1. Concept Explanation

To solve this type of problem, you must understand the relationship between electrical energy and thermal energy. I will explain from the most basic concepts step-by-step.

#### 1.1. What is Energy?

Energy is the ability to do work. All phenomena in the world are processes of energy changing from one form to another. For example, a lamp converts electrical energy into light and heat energy, and a car converts chemical energy (fuel) into kinetic energy. The basic unit of energy is the **Joule (J)**.

#### 1.2. Heat and Temperature

- **Temperature**: A measure of how hot or cold an object is. Units are Celsius ($^\circ C$) or Kelvin ($K$).
- **Heat**: Energy transferred between two objects with different temperatures. Energy always moves from high temp to low temp. Since heat is energy, Joule ($J$) can be used, but traditionally **calorie (cal)** is used often. Symbol is $cal$.
    - $1 \text{ cal}$ is the heat required to raise $1 \text{ g}$ of water by $1^\circ C$.
    - $1 \text{ kcal}$ (kilocalorie) is $1000 \text{ cal}$, the heat to raise $1 \text{ kg}$ of water by $1^\circ C$.

#### 1.3. Calculation of Heat to Raise Temperature

To raise an object's temperature, heat must be added. The required heat depends on three factors:

1.  **Mass ($m$)**: More mass needs more heat. (e.g., Heating a bathtub needs more than a cup.)
2.  **Temperature Change ($\Delta T$)**: Higher rise needs more heat. (e.g., Heating $20^\circ C \to 100^\circ C$ is harder than $20^\circ C \to 30^\circ C$.)
3.  **Type of Substance (Specific Heat, $c$)**: Different substances need different heat amounts. This unique property is **Specific Heat**.
    - **Specific Heat ($c$)**: Heat required to raise $1 \text{ kg}$ of substance by $1^\circ C$. Water's specific heat is $1 \text{ kcal/kg} \cdot ^\circ C$, which is very large. So water changes temperature slowly.

Formula combining these:

$$ Q = c \cdot m \cdot \Delta T $$

| Symbol | Meaning | Unit | Description |
| :--: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $Q$ | Heat | kcal | Total thermal energy gained/lost |
| $c$ | Specific Heat | kcal/kg·°C | Heat to raise $1 \text{ kg}$ by $1^\circ C$ |
| $m$ | Mass | kg | Amount of substance |
| $\Delta T$ | Temp Change | °C | Final Temp - Initial Temp ($T_2 - T_1$) |

#### 1.4. Electrical Energy and Power

- **Power ($P$)**: Amount of electrical energy used per second. Unit is **Watt (W)**. $1 \text{ W}$ means doing $1 \text{ J}$ of work per second ($1 \text{ W} = 1 \text{ J/s}$).
- **Energy (Electric Work, $W$)**: Total electrical energy used over time. Calculated by multiplying Power by Time.

$$ W = P \cdot t $$

| Symbol | Meaning | Unit | Description |
| :--: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $W$ | Energy | J (Joule) | Total used energy |
| $P$ | Power | W (Watt) | Energy per unit time |
| $t$ | Time | s (Second) | Usage time |

**Important**: Units must match. If Power ($P$) is Watts ($W$) and Time ($t$) is Seconds ($s$), Energy ($W$) is Joules ($J$).

#### 1.5. Joule's Law: Electricity meets Heat

Scientist James Joule discovered that electrical energy can convert to heat energy with a constant relationship. This is **Joule's Law**.

When current flows, electrons collide with atoms, generating heat called **Joule Heat**.
Conversion relationship:

$$ 1 \text{ J} \approx 0.24 \text{ cal} \quad \text{or} \quad 1 \text{ cal} \approx 4.2 \text{ J} $$

Using this constant, we calculate heat ($H$) from electrical energy ($W$).

$$ H (\text{cal}) = 0.24 \times W (\text{J}) $$

Substituting $W = P \cdot t$, we get the formula for heat from power and time.

$$ H = 0.24 \cdot P \cdot t $$

| Symbol | Meaning | Unit | **Caution** |
| :--: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $H$ | Heat | cal | **calorie** unit |
| $P$ | Power | W | **Watt** unit |
| $t$ | Time | s | **Second** unit |

#### 1.6. Stored Energy: Capacitor

Sometimes energy is stored and released at once (like a **Capacitor**), rather than continuous heating.
- **Capacitor**: Stores charge like a small battery.

Energy ($W$) stored in a capacitor:

$$ W = \frac{1}{2}CV^2 $$

| Symbol | Meaning | Unit | Description |
| :--: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $W$ | Stored Energy | J | Total energy stored |
| $C$ | Capacitance | F | Ability to store charge |
| $V$ | Voltage | V | Applied voltage |

When discharged through a resistor, all this energy ($W$) turns to heat.
Heat ($H$) generated upon discharge:

$$ H (\text{cal}) = 0.24 \times W (\text{J}) = 0.24 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}CV^2\right) $$

#### 1.7. Practical Formula: $1 \text{ kWh} = 860 \text{ kcal}$

Exams often give Power in $\text{kW}$ and Time in $\text{h}$. Converting to W and s is tedious.
- $1 \text{ kW} = 1000 \text{ W}$
- $1 \text{ h} = 3600 \text{ s}$

Energy $1 \text{ kWh}$ in heat:
1.  To Joules: $1000 \text{ W} \times 3600 \text{ s} = 3,600,000 \text{ J}$
2.  To kcal: $3,600,000 \text{ J} \times 0.24 \frac{\text{cal}}{\text{J}} = 864,000 \text{ cal} = 864 \text{ kcal}$

Using accurate constant ($4.186 J/cal$), it's approx $860 \text{ kcal}$. This is the standard in electricity.

$$ 1 \text{ kWh} = 860 \text{ kcal} $$

This yields a very useful formula:

$$ H = 860 \cdot P \cdot t $$

| Symbol | Meaning | Unit | **Caution** |
| :--: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $H$ | Heat | kcal | **kilocalorie** unit |
| $P$ | Power | kW | **kilowatt** unit |
| $t$ | Time | h | **hour** unit |

This formula makes calculation very fast when units are $\text{kcal, kW, h}$.

#### 1.8. Efficiency ($\eta$)

Devices don't convert 100% energy. **Efficiency** is the ratio of useful output to total input.

$$ \text{Efficiency}(\eta) = \frac{\text{Useful Output Energy}}{\text{Total Input Energy}} \times 100 (\%) $$

For heaters:
$$ \text{Heat to Water (Useful)} = \text{Electric Energy consumed} \times \text{Efficiency}(\eta) $$

So, required electric energy is:
$$ \text{Electric Energy consumed} = \frac{\text{Heat to Water}}{\text{Efficiency}(\eta)} $$

If efficiency is 85%, use $\eta=0.85$.

### 2. Standard Problem Explanation

**Problem**: Heat 50L water from 15°C to 55°C in 1 hour using heater with 85% efficiency. Find Power [kW]. (Specific heat $1 \text{ kcal/kg} \cdot ^\circ C$)

#### **Step 1: Analyze & Organize**

- **Goal**: Power ($P$) in $\text{kW}$.
- **Given**:
    - Efficiency $\eta = 0.85$
    - $T_1 = 15^\circ C$, $T_2 = 55^\circ C$
    - Volume $V = 50 \text{ L}$
    - Time $t = 1 \text{ h}$
    - Specific heat $c = 1 \text{ kcal/kg} \cdot ^\circ C$

#### **Step 2: Calc Required Heat ($Q$)**

Formula: $Q = c \cdot m \cdot \Delta T$

1.  **Mass ($m$)**: Water density is $1 \text{ kg/L}$. So $50 \text{ L} \to 50 \text{ kg}$.
2.  **$\Delta T$**: $55 - 15 = 40^\circ C$.
3.  **Calc $Q$**:
    $Q = 1 \times 50 \times 40 = 2000 \text{ kcal}$.

This $2000 \text{ kcal}$ is the **useful heat** water needs.

#### **Step 3: Calc Total Electric Energy ($W_{elec}$) considering Efficiency**

Formula: $\text{Input} = \frac{\text{Output}}{\eta}$

$W_{elec} = \frac{2000 \text{ kcal}}{0.85} \approx 2352.94 \text{ kcal}$.

The heater must consume this much energy.

#### **Step 4: Calc Power ($P$)**

Since we have energy in $\text{kcal}$ and time in $\text{h}$, and need $\text{kW}$, use $H = 860 \cdot P \cdot t$.
Here $H$ is the total electric energy $W_{elec}$.

$$ P = \frac{W_{elec}}{860 \cdot t} $$

- $W_{elec} \approx 2352.94$
- $t = 1$

$P = \frac{2352.94}{860 \times 1} \approx 2.736 \text{ kW}$

#### **Step 5: Select Answer**

Closest to 2.736 is ② 2.7.

**Final Answer**: ②

---
**[Alternative]** Using $H=0.24Pt$
1. $Q = 2000 \text{ kcal} = 2,000,000 \text{ cal}$.
2. Input = $2,000,000 / 0.85 \approx 2,352,941 \text{ cal}$.
3. $t = 1 \text{ h} = 3600 \text{ s}$.
4. $P = \frac{2,352,941}{0.24 \times 3600} \approx 2723 \text{ W} = 2.72 \text{ kW}$.
Result is same.

### **Problem Type: Electrostatics (Force, Field, Potential, Dielectric, Capacitor)**

**Standard Problem:**
There is a point charge of $3 \times 10^{-8}$ C in air. What is the potential difference (V) between point A, 1 m away from this charge, and point B, 3 m away?

---

### 1. Concept Explanation

To solve this, we must build concepts from the ground up: Charge $\to$ Force $\to$ Field $\to$ Potential $\to$ Capacitor.

#### 1.1. The Beginning: Electric Charge

Matter consists of atoms with protons (+) and electrons (-). The quantity of this 'electrical property' is **Charge**.

*   **Types**: Positive (+) and Negative (-).
*   **Unit**: **Coulomb (C)**.
*   **Properties**:
    *   Like charges repel (**Repulsion**).
    *   Opposite charges attract (**Attraction**).
*   **Point Charge**: An ideal model where charge size is ignored, treated as a 'point'.

#### 1.2. Force: Coulomb's Law

The force between two charges.

*   **Magnitude**:
    1.  Proportional to product of charges ($Q_1 \times Q_2$).
    2.  Inversely proportional to **square of distance ($r^2$)**. (Distance $\times 2 \to$ Force $\times 1/4$).

#### 1.3. Medium & Field: Permittivity and Electric Field

**1) Permittivity ($\epsilon$)**:
Property of the medium indicating how well it transmits electric force.
*   High $\epsilon$: Force gets **weaker** (more obstruction).
*   Low $\epsilon$: Force gets **stronger**.
*   Formula: $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \times \epsilon_s$ (Vacuum Permittivity $\times$ Relative Permittivity).

**2) Electric Field ($E$)**:
The space where electric force is exerted.
*   **Intensity ($E$)**: Force experienced by $+1$ C charge. $E = F/Q$. Unit: [N/C] or [V/m].

**3) Formulas**:

| Quantity | Formula (with $\epsilon$) | Formula (Air/Vacuum, with $k$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Force** | $$F = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon} \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}$$ | $$F = k \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}$$ |
| **Field** | $$E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon} \frac{Q}{r^2}$$ | $$E = k \frac{Q}{r^2}$$ |

*   **Coulomb Constant ($k$)**: $k \approx 9 \times 10^9$ in air/vacuum. **Use this for most problems.**

**4) Electric Field Lines**:
Visual lines representing the field.
*   **Properties (Important!)**: Start at (+), end at (-). Tangent is field direction. Never cross. Density = Strength. Perpendicular to conductor surface. **Does not exist inside a conductor.**

#### 1.4. Electrical Potential Energy: Potential ($V$)

Electrical "Height" or potential energy level.

*   **Definition**: Work done to bring $+1$ C from infinity to a point.
    *   $V = W/Q$. Unit: **Volt (V)**.
*   **Point Charge Potential Formula**:
    $$ V = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon} \frac{Q}{r} \quad \text{or} \quad V = k \frac{Q}{r} $$
    *   **Crucial Difference**: Force/Field is $\propto 1/r^2$, Potential is $\propto 1/r$. Don't confuse them!
*   **Potential Difference**: $V_{AB} = V_A - V_B$. Driving force of current.

#### 1.5. Capacitor

Component storing charge.
*   **Capacitance ($C$)**: Ability to store charge. $C = Q/V$. Unit: **Farad (F)**.
*   **Parallel Plate Capacitor**:
    $$ C = \epsilon \frac{A}{d} $$
    *   To increase $C$: High $\epsilon$, Large Area ($A$), Small Distance ($d$).
*   **Electrostatic Attraction**: Force between plates. Proportional to **Voltage squared ($V^2$)**.

#### 1.6. Conductor & Shielding

*   **Conductor**: Charge stays on surface. **Internal Field is 0.** Equipotential.
*   **Electrostatic Shielding**: Enclosing with conductor to block external field.

---

### 2. Standard Problem Explanation

**Problem:** Charge $3 \times 10^{-8}$ C. Potential difference between A (1m) and B (3m)?

#### **Step 1: Analyze**

*   $Q = 3 \times 10^{-8}$ C
*   Medium: Air ($k = 9 \times 10^9$)
*   $r_A = 1$ m, $r_B = 3$ m
*   Goal: $V_{AB} = V_A - V_B$

#### **Step 2: Apply Formula**

Potential formula: $V = k \frac{Q}{r}$.
$$ V_{AB} = \left( k \frac{Q}{r_A} \right) - \left( k \frac{Q}{r_B} \right) $$

#### **Step 3: Calculate**

**1. Potential at A ($V_A$)**
$$ V_A = (9 \times 10^9) \times \frac{3 \times 10^{-8}}{1} $$
$$ V_A = 27 \times 10^1 = 270 \text{ V} $$

**2. Potential at B ($V_B$)**
$$ V_B = (9 \times 10^9) \times \frac{3 \times 10^{-8}}{3} $$
$$ V_B = 9 \times 10^1 = 90 \text{ V} $$

**3. Potential Difference ($V_{AB}$)**
$$ V_{AB} = 270 - 90 = 180 \text{ V} $$

#### **Step 4: Check**

Closer point (A) has higher potential. $270 > 90$. Correct.

**Final Answer: 180**

### 3. Patterns & Intent

#### **Pattern 1: Calculating F, E, V**
*   **Example**: "Force between 10μC and 20μC at 1m?"
*   **Trap**: Confusing $1/r^2$ (Force/Field) with $1/r$ (Potential).

#### **Pattern 4: Definitions**
*   **Example**: "Properties of Field Lines", "Electrostatic Shielding".

#### **3. Summary**

1.  **Coulomb Force**: Most frequent calculation.
2.  **Field Lines**: Frequent True/False concept questions.
3.  **W=QV**: Simple calc.
4.  **Capacitor**: $C = \epsilon A/d$ logic.

Mastering the distinction between **Force/Field ($1/r^2$)** and **Potential ($1/r$)** is the key to calculation problems.
